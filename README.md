# Task-3

Objective: Use free tools to identify common vulnerabilities on your computer.

Tools: OpenVAS Community Edition (free vulnerability scanner).
 
Deliverables: Vulnerability scan report with identified issues.

**Step 1: Installing OpenVAS**
manually download and install the new key
sudo wget https://archive.kali.org/archive-keyring.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg

Updated system packages:

Took me awhile but running below commands solver the issue

sudo apt-get install kali-desktop-core

Ran initial setup:
sudo gvm-setup
This configured the database, services, and fetched vulnerability data.
This installation process took along time about 45-60 mins.

Checked the installation:
sudo gvm-check-setup

**Step 2: Setting Up Scan Target**
Logged into the Greenbone Security Assistant web UI at https://localhost:9392.
Navigated to Configuration → Targets → New Target.
Filled in the following:
Name: "Localhost Vulnerability Test"
Host: 127.0.0.1
Port List: All TCP and UDP (default)
Saved the target.

**Step 3: Launching a Full Vulnerability Scan**
Navigated to Scans → Tasks → New Task.
Provided task details:
Name: "Full Localhost Scan"
Scan Config: Full and Fast
Target: Localhost (created earlier)
Started the scan by clicking Start Task.

**Step 4: Wait for Scan to Complete**
Duration: Approximately 45–60 minutes
Scanner performed the following checks:
Port scanning (TCP/UDP)
Service enumeration
Banner grabbing
CVE checking based on plugin database
Verified progress from dashboard.

**Step 5: Reviewing the Report**
Once complete, clicked on the task to open the Report.
Observed a color-coded summary:
Red: Critical vulnerabilities
Orange: High
Yellow: Medium
Green: Low
Blue: Log/Info


**Results Summary**
Summary of Findings
Risk Level	Number of Vulnerabilities
Critical	0
High	3
Medium	4
Low	6
Info	5

**Conclusion**
This project has been instrumental in bridging theoretical knowledge of cybersecurity with practical hands-on experience. I now understand how to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities in real systems and how crucial vulnerability management is to maintaining secure IT infrastructure.
